LLMs are great at making up stuff - this is the best way to use it


# what am i making?

this is a cli application that use calls to some LLM that talks to itself over and over to build a giant block of text for your literary needs:

- scripture
- history
- legends
- fables
- dynasties
- plots

# what's the input?

- World Map (written or drawn)
- Factions (fantasy races, clans, gangs, whatever)
- Themes
- Characters
- Conflicts
- More

# What's the output?

- a directory of conversations
- a directory of actual historical events
- a directory of "remembered" historical events
- a summary of the current state of history

# What's the catch?

the more thought you put into the first (and subsequent) generations, the less generic the final output.
